A Pseudo Emulator based on the 6502
===================================

About
--------

This project is a sort of pseudo emulator that I wrote for a "PDP-8" for Roblox. This
follows the language and syntax for Luau and the objects for the Roblox engine.

> This is meant to be used within Roblox.
> It tries to replicate the 6502 architecture with the instructions it had.
> It exists as a module


Note
--------
I wish I could've been more accurate but Lua doesn't allow many low level conventions.
I can't have a specific bit size for values and I'm stuck using double float values.
It's not really specific to any Architecture and it lacks the bitwise operations that are
done realistically.
